## PiliBoost Streaming Accelerator (experimental V1a)

New fork features use the PiliBoost name. The accelerator is OFF by default;
select Auto or Smart CDN under Audio/Video Settings → Streaming Accelerator.
V1a keeps existing CDN preferences and DASH EDL playback, uses bounded media
Range probes only during sustained low buffering, and applies EWMA, switching
gain thresholds and cooldown. Failures return to the original source.
Multi-Range, parallel Multi-CDN and live acceleration are not implemented in V1a.
See `docs/accelerator/V1.md` for implementation/test status and `NOTICE` for
algorithm references and attribution.

### V1c local Range relay (experimental)

Streaming Accelerator now has a separate, opt-in single-upstream Proxy mode. DASH video uses a loopback relay; audio stays direct. It streams player GET/HEAD/single-range requests, supports seeking, and reports forwarded video bytes and an approximately three-second rate window. It does not probe/switch CDNs, prefetch, cache, or download in parallel. Existing Auto/Smart CDN behavior is unchanged; OFF remains the default. Relay errors attempt original-source recovery and bypass the relay for that session. See `docs/accelerator/V1C.md` for verification and device-test boundaries.
